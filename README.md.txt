Project Overview:
Objective: Scrape the latest news articles from a news website and display the headlines and summaries.
Skills: Web scraping, HTML parsing, requests handling, and working with APIs.
Technologies: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests.
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Install Python libraries:
Install the required libraries by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Step 2: Write the Web Scraper Script
This is an example of a simple scraper that fetches news headlines from a website like BBC News.

python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Function to fetch the latest headlines
def fetch_news():
    # URL of the news website
    url = 'https://www.bbc.com/news'
    
    # Send HTTP request
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # Check if request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        
        # Find all news headlines using the HTML structure of the website
        headlines = soup.find_all('h3', class_='gs-c-promo-heading__title')
        
        # Print the headlines
        print("Latest News Headlines:")
        for i, headline in enumerate(headlines, start=1):
            print(f"{i}. {headline.get_text()}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve news. Status code: {response.status_code}")

# Main function to run the scraper
def main():
    fetch_news()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Step 3: How the Code Works
Requests library is used to send an HTTP request to the target news website.
BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content of the website and find the news headlines.
The script prints the latest headlines fetched from the BBC News website.
Step 4: Enhancements and Features
You can expand the project by adding the following enhancements:

Multiple News Sources: Add scraping from other websites like CNN, New York Times, etc.
Save Results to File: Store the headlines in a text file or CSV file for later analysis.
GUI Application: Create a simple GUI with Tkinter to display the results.
Filter by Categories: Allow users to filter the news by category (e.g., sports, politics).
Error Handling: Add error handling for failed requests, timeouts, or empty results.
Step 5: Create a GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., python-web-scraper).
Add a README.md file that explains:
What the project does.
How to run the scraper.
Any libraries or dependencies required.
Commit your code and push to GitHub.
